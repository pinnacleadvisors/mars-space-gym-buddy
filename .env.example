# Supabase Configuration
# These are PUBLIC keys that can be safely committed (they're used client-side)
# However, for cloud development, it's better to use GitHub Codespaces Secrets

# Supabase Project URL
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-id.supabase.co

# Supabase Anonymous/Public Key (safe to expose client-side)
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key-here

# Note: For Supabase Edge Functions, these are set in Supabase Dashboard:
# - SUPABASE_URL
# - SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
# - SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY (keep this secret!)
# - STRIPE_SECRET_KEY (keep this secret!)

# For GitHub Actions CI/CD, set these as repository secrets:
# - SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN
# - SUPABASE_PROJECT_ID
